Installation Process
====================

Installation is pretty simple and quick. Eventum already bundles the libraries 
that it needs to work properly:

- JpGraph 1.5.3 (last GPL version)
- Smarty 2.3.0 (http://smarty.php.net)
- PEAR packages
- dTree 2.0.5 (http://www.destroydrop.com/javascript/tree/)
- dynCalendar.js (http://www.phpguru.org/dyncalendar.html)
- overLIB 3.5.1 (http://www.bosrup.com/web/overlib/)
- A few other small javascript libraries

Anyway, all you should have to do is place the Eventum files in a directory that
is viewable from the web, and open it up with your browser. Eventum should
redirect you to the installation screen, and it will try to guess some of
required parameters, like path in the server and etc.

  http://yourserver.com/eventum/

If Eventum's installation script finds that it needs a few directories or
permissions changed, it will print the warnings before actually displaying
the installation screen. So just fix what it says it's wrong/missing and
everything should go well.

After the installation is done, you should go and take all of the available
privileges from the '/setup' directory, so other people are not allowed to
go in there and mess with your configuration.
