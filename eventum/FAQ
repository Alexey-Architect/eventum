Trouble Shooting

Problem: I get the message "Error: Cookies support seem to be disabled in 
    your browser. Please enable this feature and try again".
Solution: There are many things that could cause this problem.
 - Double check that cookies are enabled in your browser.
 - Check that time settings on the client and server are correct. If the client
    time is set ahead of the server, the cookie could automatically delete
    itself.
 - Check if you have a firewall or antivirus program that could be blocking
    cookies from being set.

Problem: The filters on /list.php aren't working.
Solution: Are you using suPHP? There is a known bug in suPHP 
(see http://lists.marsching.biz/pipermail/suphp/2004-June/000746.html) where if
a URL ends with '=', parameters to a page are not processed correctly. Please
disable suPHP and see if the problem is fixed.
