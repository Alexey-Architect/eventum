<h4>{t}Installation Instructions{/t}</h4>
<span class="default">
{t}The process_commits.pl script, which is available in the misc 
sub-directory in your Eventum installation directory, will need to be 
installed in your CVSROOT CVS module by following the procedure below:{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}The first thing to do is to checkout the CVSROOT module from your CVS
repository:{/t}
<br /><br />
<b>$ cvs -d %CVS REPOSITORY HERE% checkout CVSROOT</b>
<br /><br />
{t}The command above will checkout and create the CVSROOT directory that
you will need to work with. Next, open the <b>loginfo</b> file and
add the following line:{/t}
<br /><br />
{literal}
<b>ALL /usr/bin/php %repository path%/CVSROOT/process_cvs_commits.php $USER %{sVv}</b>
{/literal}
<br /><br />
{t}Replace %repository path% by the appropriate absolute path in your
CVS server, such as /home/username/repository for instance. Also make
sure to put the appropriate path to your Perl binary.{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}You may also turn the parsing of commit messages for just a single CVS
module by substituting the 'ALL' in the line above to the appropriate
CVS module name, as in:{/t}
<br /><br />
{literal}
<b>%cvs module name% /usr/bin/php %repository path%/CVSROOT/process_cvs_commits.php $USER %{sVv}</b>
{/literal}
<br /><br />
{t}The last step of this installation process is to login into the CVS
server and copy the process_cvs_commits.php script into the CVSROOT 
directory. Make sure you give the appropriate permissions to the 
script.{/t}
